    <h1>Rice and Tzatziki</h1>
    <img src="../images/Tzatziki.jpeg"
    <p>Tzatziki is a delicious quick and easy dish to make. 
        Pair it with rice to make a filling meal full of flavor!
        As delicious as this dish is, <em>it is lacking in some areas of nutrition,</em>
        particularly <i>protein</i>, and it could use more vegetables. To make a complete
        meal, I recommend a side salad with your choice of protein, or some healthy
        appetizers on the side.
