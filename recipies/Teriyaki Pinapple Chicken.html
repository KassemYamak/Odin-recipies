    <h1>Teriyaki Pinapple Chicken</h1>
    <img src="../images/teriyaki.jpeg">
    <p><b>Teriyaki Pinapple Chicken</b> is both sweet and salty dish with very little prep work, however
        it is recommended to marinate the chicken for at least an hour to let
        the flavor soak through before cooking. The chicken can be left unattended during this time, or if you
        simply cannot wait, go ahead and cook it sooner. This dish is excellent with a wide variety of veggies, 
        so many in fact, I couldn't decide which to recommend. <strong>If you are like me and are adding a lot of vegetables
        you may need to make a little more to the sauce mixture. The sauce is quite strong and only a drizzle is needed on the 
        vegetables, which this recipie will leave you with, but if you need several drizzles for a bad amount of veggies, add 
        add more of everything keeping the ratio at about the same.
